Combinations:

1.
  keep_prob = 0.5
  learning_rate = 0.001
  epochs = 5
  batch_size = 10
  minLoss = 0.341
  comments - Loss has a trend of decrease. Need more epochs

2.
  keep_prob = 0.5
  learning_rate = 0.001
  epochs = 10
  batch_size = 10
  minLoss = 0.2986
  Comments - Loss is oscillating around 0.3. Need lower learning rate or less batch size.

3.
  keep_prob = 0.5
  learning_rate = 0.001
  epochs = 10
  batch_size = 5
  minLoss = 0.1883
  Comments - Loss is decreasing but slight oscillating. Need more epochs. Batch size is minimum

4.
  keep_prob = 0.5
  learning_rate = 0.001
  epochs = 15
  batch_size = 5
  minLoss = 0.1357
  Comments = Loss is oscillating. Definitely need lower learning rate. Epochs are fine for this learning_rate

5.
  keep_prob = 0.5
  learning_rate = 0.0008
  epochs = 15
  batch_size = 5
  minLoss = 0.1455
  Comments = Learning rate in step 4 seems to be fine. Try with this one increasing epochs

6.
  keep_prob = 0.5
  learning_rate = 0.0008
  epochs = 20
  batch_size = 5
  minLoss = 0.1203
  Comments - Loss is decreased, but not very sigficantly. Trying with more epochs and save of Images

  6.
  keep_prob = 0.5
  learning_rate = 0.0008
  epochs = 25
  batch_size = 5
  minLoss =
